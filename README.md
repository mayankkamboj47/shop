# How to Start
## 1. Clone both these repositories

__backend__ - https://github.com/mayankkamboj47/shop-backend.git


__frontend__ - https://github.com/mayankkamboj47/shop.git                           <== you're in this repo right now

by executing `git clone <reponame>`. Replace `<reponame>` with the urls above. 

## 2. Start the frontend and backend servers

Go to where you cloned the repos. You'll see two new folders, one for each repo. `cd` into each of the folders and execute

```
npm install
npm start
```

Note : Once you do this for one folder, you will need to open another terminal window or tab to repeat the process for the other folder. Don't Ctrl + C the terminal as it will stop the server.
